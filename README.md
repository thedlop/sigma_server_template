# What is this?
A Bootstrapped es6/express server for quick access to libergo. This is helpful if your preferred programming language
is not supported by https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/tree/develop/bindings . This should only be used locally.

# Who to thank?
I am not a JS programmer so all the boostrapped code was copied from https://github.com/GeekyGeeky/es6_setup_node. Thank you my friend!

The example libergo code was copied from https://github.com/anon-real/ErgoAuctionHouse . Thank you! I highly recommend reading this source for learning
about using libergo.

# How to use
Install dependencies - `npm install`
Run Server           - `npm start run:dev`


Add new endpoints to `src/app.js` that interact with libergo.
Hit this server locally with your main application.
That's it!
